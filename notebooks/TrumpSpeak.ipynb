        "\n",
        "A text-to-speech (TTS) application where you can generate a voice that sounds like the dumbest idiot to have ever been born. The model was trained using Tacotron and the voice is synthesized using a pretrained WaveRNN vocoder. The Trump model already sounded great at 30K steps (from SCRATCH, not a refinement of existing models - crazy, right?!) using 8 hours of professionally cleaned and sliced audio. Overfitting then caused a massive increase in duration loss. I generated the audio and transcript dataset with a tool I specifically created for this specific purpose. Preparing the data only took about 4 hours, not including the time to rip the videos from YouTube. Training took 8 hours. I have no intention of releasing my dataset preparation tool due to how  insanely trivial it makes the process of duplicating someone's voice. Most of the code used here was taken from [ForwardTacotron](https://github.com/as-ideas/ForwardTacotron).\n",
